Radio Scripts
=============

These are some old radio scripts that I used (that still work) to run an
Internet radio station using LiquidSoap, Icecast, and Python. You can use them
to create your own Internet radio station. Multiple DJs are supported, which
each DJ specifying their own individual password. The playlist is controlled
by an external Python script.

Some forms of these scripts have been running for ~6 years now. <3 LiquidSoap.
